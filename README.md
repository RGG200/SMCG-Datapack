| Installing the pack ↓ |

- Firstly Dowload the pack here --> https://codeload.github.com/RGG200/SMGminecraftdatapack/zip/refs/heads/main

- Secondly Donwload the Super Minecraft Galaxy map made by Chasin_jason here --> https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/super-minecraft-galaxy-1-16-4-100-complete/

- Then unzip the Datapack and the map with winrar or 7zip. If you don't have winrar or 7zip download winrar here --> https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=10

- After that you should have a folder called Super Minecraft Galaxy This is the map.

- Then we need to drag the map to the AppData folder using the combination Win + R

- In the text box type "AppData" then go to Roaming then .minecraft then saves then open another explorer and go to Download or where you have the map in and drag the map to the explorer tab in the folder saves

- Finally take the datapack folder (it should be named SMGminecraftdatapack pre beta version 0.2.1
[SMGminecraftdatapack Pre Beta version 0.2.1.zip](https://github.com/RGG200/SMGminecraftdatapack/files/6510065/SMGminecraftdatapack.Pre.Beta.version.0.2.1.zip)
and go to your map folder (In the folder "saves") and go to datapacks and drag the SMGminecraftdapack pre beta version 0.2.1 in.

| Setup | Pre Beta Version 0.2.1 |
- Put these in some repeating Command block :
- /function smg:energy
- /function smg:weakmario
- /function smg:tick
- /function smg:revive
- /function smg:fantom
- /function smg:give
- /function smg:info

-  Then put these in a fast clock but not too fast you can set it after as you think it is the best for the life system ( If don't set correctly you will have some issues !)
- /function smglives (Obviously you know what this does.)


- Finally put these in a slower clock then the other one (VERY IMPORTANT).
- /function smg:deaths
